## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder 1  
**Problems/Frustrations:**  

1. Sometimes when I want to study in Bobst Library, it’s hard to find a place, and I don’t know where there are a lot of people or where there are fewer people.  
2. I want to easily access the library information through an app form instead of rapidly checking the website. I want to know the behavioral requirements (food/drink allowance, quiet space or not, etc.) for each floor.  
3. Sometimes I need to use printers in the Library, but I can’t identify the available printers and the waiting time. Sometimes, they are broken, too.   

### Stakeholder 2  
**Problems/Frustrations:** 

4. Book search: I’m too shy to ask the librarian where a specific book is… Maybe that’s why I don’t really borrow books from the library.  
5. I see interesting events or exhibitions going around in the library… but I only see those posters in person; I would like to see what ongoing events and exhibitions are currently happening in the library.  

**Summary of Goals/Needs:**  
- The app should help identify less crowded areas in the library to make it easier to find a study spot.  
- The app should provide quick access to floor-specific behavioral rules (e.g., noise levels, food policies).  
- The app should show the availability and status of printers in real-time. 
- The app should include a book search feature to help users find books independently.  
- The app should provide a digital list of library events and exhibitions to keep users informed.
