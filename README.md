## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder 1  
**Problems/Frustrations:**  

1. Sometimes when I want to study in Bobst Library, it’s hard to find a place, and I don’t know where there are a lot of people or where there are fewer people.  
2. I want to easily access the library information through an app form instead of rapidly checking the website. I want to know the behavioral requirements (food/drink allowance, quiet space or not, etc.) for each floor.  
3. Sometimes I need to use printers in the Library, but I can’t identify the available printers and the waiting time. Sometimes, they are broken, too.   

### Stakeholder 2  
**Problems/Frustrations:** 

4. Book search: I’m too shy to ask the librarian where a specific book is… Maybe that’s why I don’t really borrow books from the library.  
5. I see interesting events or exhibitions going around in the library… but I only see those posters in person; I would like to see what ongoing events and exhibitions are currently happening in the library.  

**Summary of Goals/Needs:**  
- The app should help identify less crowded areas in the library to make it easier to find a study spot.  
- The app should provide quick access to floor-specific behavioral rules (e.g., noise levels, food policies).  
- The app should show the availability and status of printers in real-time. 
- The app should include a book search feature to help users find books independently.  
- The app should provide a digital list of library events and exhibitions to keep users informed.  

## Product Vision Statement

Create a smart library service app that provides real-time space availability, library guidelines, printer status, book navigation, and event updates to enhance the Bobst Library experience.

## User Requirements

1. As a student, I want to view the real-time availability of study space so that I can find a quiet place to study.
2. As a freshman, I want to check the rules for each library floor so that I can choose the right place to work.
3. As an exhibitor, I want more students or faculty members to know about my exhibition in the library, so that more people can enjoy the exhibition.
4. As an art student, I want to access the ongoing exhibitions so that I can explore different artworks and look for inspiration for my work.
5. As a teacher assistant, I want to be able to use a printer when I get there, so that I won’t need to waste my time checking which printer is broken or running out of paper.
6. As a faculty, I want to view the current academic workshops or the events happening in the library, so that I will not miss the events that interest me.
7. As a PhD student, I want to know where to find the books in my current field of study so that I can easily locate the books I need for my research.
8. As a professor who often forgets to bring things,  I want to be able to get information about the library’s lost and found so that there are larger chances for me to get my stuff back.
9. As a student who has upcoming midterms, I want to see the availability of printers, so that I won’t spend too much time waiting in lines and being late to my exams. 
10. As a student who lives far away from home, sometimes I need to borrow laptop chargers from other people so that I can continue to do my homework without going around asking and interrupting everyone in the quiet library.
